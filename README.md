### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Hi, Iâ€™m Milan.
- Iâ€™m interested in robotics.
- Iâ€™m currently learning programming, microelectronics, and statistics & probability.
- I'm originally from Hungary.
- I'm a junior in electrical engineering. 
- I chose my major because I am interested in robotics, and coding. 
- A fun fact about me is:  I'm part of the UH swim team, so if you want to have some fun check out our dual meet schedule.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Object oriented programming. 
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  I really liked the movie Snowdan (2016).
